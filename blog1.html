			<p>
				On 14th of December, Google core services like Gmail, Youtube, Drive etc
				was down for about 50-60 minutes.But actually thses services where
				actually working. The think that went down was the Google Authentication
				System itself , called CIMS(Central Identity Management System). Every
				user that went to access the authenticated services weren't able to
				access it, because they weren't authenticated by CIMS.However , if you
				have used incognito mode to go into these services, you wouldn't have
				faced any problems because, it doesn't need you to be an authenticated
				user.
				<strong>So how CIMS went down.</strong>The root cause was an issue in
				their automated quota management system which reduced capacity for the
				google's CIMS, causing it to return errors globaly.As a result, they
				couldn't authenticate the users and served error to the users.
