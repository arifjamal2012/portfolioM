					HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request
					has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five
					classes:
					<li>1. Informational responses (100–199)</li>
					<li>2. Successful responses (200–299)</li>
					<li>3. Redirects (300–399)</li>
					<li>4. Client errors (400–499)</li>
					<li>5. Server errors (500–599)</li>
					<div>
						<strong class="blog2para">Informational response</strong>
						<p class="blog2heading1">100 Continue</p>
						<p>
							This interim response indicates that everything so far is OK and
							that the client should continue the request, or ignore the
							response if the request is already finished.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<strong class="blog2para2"> Successful responses</strong>
						<p class="blog2heading2">200 Ok</p>
						<p>
							The request has succeeded. The meaning of the success depends on
							the HTTP method:
							<li>
								GET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the
								message body.
							</li>
							<li>HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body.</li>
							<li>
								PUT/POST: The resource describing the result of the action is
								transmitted in the message body.
							</li>
							<li>
								TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received
								by the server.
							</li>
						</p>
						<p class="blog2heading2">201 Created</p>
						<p>
							The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a
							result. This is typically the response sent after POST requests,
							or some PUT requests.
						</p>
						<p class="blog2heading2">204 No Content</p>
						<p>
							There is no content to send for this request, but the headers may
							be useful. The user-agent may update its cached headers for this
							resource with the new ones.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<strong class="blog2para3"> Redirection messages</strong>
						<p class="blog2heading3">304 Not Modified</p>
						<p>
							This is used for caching purposes. It tells the client that the
							response has not been modified, so the client can continue to use
							the same cached version of the response.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<strong class="blog2para4">Client error responses</strong>
						<p class="blog2heading4">400 Bad Request</p>
						<p>
							The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed
							syntax. The client should not repeat the request without
							modifications.
						</p>
						<p class="blog2heading4">401 Unauthorized</p>
						<p>
							Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", semantically
							this response means "unauthenticated". That is, the client must
							authenticate itself to get the requested response.
						</p>
						<p class="blog2heading4">403 Forbidden</p>
						<p>
							The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it
							is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested
							resource. Unlike 401, the client's identity is known to the
							server.
						</p>
						<p class="blog2heading4">404 Not Found</p>
						<p>
							The server can not find the requested resource. In the browser,
							this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also
							mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not
							exist. Servers may also send this response instead of 403 to hide
							the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This
							response code is probably the most famous one due to its frequent
							occurrence on the web.
						</p>
						<p class="blog2heading4">409 Conflict</p>
						<p>
							This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current
							state of the server.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<strong class="blog2para5">Server error responses</strong>
						<p class="blog2heading5">500 Internal Server Error</p>
						<p>
							The server has encountered a situation it doesn't know how to
							handle.
						</p>
